# VBA-challenge
# this code curses through 3 years of stock market data and creates two summaries:

# this first summary will give you the change in dollar amount of each stock value from the opening of the first day of the given year, to the closing stock value of the last day of the given year. 

# This code also uses conditional formating to highlight in green if there was an increase in dollar amount, and red if there was a decrease in dollar amount.

# in addition to the change in dollar amount, it will summarize the percentage change of the each stock from the begining of the year, to the end of the year.

# lastly, the code will give you the total stock volume moved for the entire year for each stock.

#  the second summary will output which stock had the greatest increase from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the greatest decrease, and finally, which stock had the highest volume for the given year.
